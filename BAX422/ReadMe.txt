For this project my team and I collected data from two main sources. The RAWG API and the Meteoritic website. 
We used the RAWG API to determine what games were the most relevant to check the reviews for based on the highest rated games on Metacritic from 2020 and 2021 as well as the most popular games according to RAWG from the same timeframe.

We stored the data in a MongoDB document based format. This format allowed for easier collection of the review text data which we would later analyze using NLP.
