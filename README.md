# UC Davis
 A place where I store projects from my time at UC Davis MSBA.
 
 The main course content I have uploaded is from the course labeled BAX 422. This courses title is "Data Design & Representation". We went over topics such as MongoDB, API's, and web scraping. I really enjoyed this class and appreciate the approval of Professor [JÃ¶rn Boehnke](https://jboehnke.com/) to upload this material to GitHub.
 
 These projects have been uploaded with approval from the professors at UC Davis.
